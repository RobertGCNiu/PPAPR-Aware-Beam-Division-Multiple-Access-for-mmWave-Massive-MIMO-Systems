\begin{abstract}
Beam division multiple access (BDMA) has recently been proposed for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems by simultaneously transmitting multiple users' data streams via different beams. Despite its many advantages, BDMA may suffer from a larger peak-to-average-power ratio (PAPR) as the number of transmit antennas increases. In this work, we propose to explicitly incorporate the PAPR constraints into the BDMA design by jointly performing hybrid analog-digital precoding and user-beam scheduling. More specifically, the proposed scheme designs the digital precoder with explicit PAPR constraints. In addition, in sharp contrast to the conventional hybrid precoder that solely relies on the digital precoder for interference suppression, the proposed scheme opportunistically schedules users who are near orthogonal in the analog beam domain. To efficiently compute the optimal hybrid precoder and user-beam scheduling, we develop a greedy algorithm that first opportunistically selects users before their corresponding hybrid precoders are derived with explicit PAPR constraints. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of proposed PAPR-aware BDMA scheme.

To meet the ever-increasing demand of higher user data rates, it is envisioned that the next-generation cellular systems will be equipped with massive antenna arrays \cite{boccardi2014five}. Capitalizing on the large number of antennas at the base-station (BS), beam division multiple access (BDMA) has been recently proposed to transmit multiple users' data streams via different beams \cite{sun2015beam, Jiang2018}. In contrast to the more conventional multiple access schemes such as Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) or Orthogonal Frequency Multiple Division Access (OFDMA) that multiplex users in code, time and frequency domains, BDMA separates users in the beam space by transmitting data to different users in orthogonal beam directions. Furthermore, BDMA works particularly well as the multiple access scheme for millimeter wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmissions as mmWave channels are shown to have very limited scattering paths\cite{alkhateeb2014channel}. By exploiting the vast vacant spectrum available at radio frequencies (RF) of $6$ GHz or above, multiuser mmWave systems equipped with BDMA are expected to be capable of supporting data throughput on the order of Gbps.

While massive MIMO systems are very effective in providing large antenna gains, two critical challenges remain in implementation. First, a large number of RF chains will be required if each antenna has to individually amplify its transmit signal (a process commonly coined as the digital precoding), which incurs prohibitively high cost and complexity. Second, nonlinear but yet power-efficient power amplifiers (PAs) are preferable due to their lower cost. In this respect, the transmit signals are required to have low peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) to avoid signal spectral spreading and in-band distortion caused by PA nonlinearities at the BS \cite{mohammed2013per}.

To cope with the first implementation challenge, hybrid analog and digital precoding has recently been developed for massive MIMO systems by dividing the procoding process into two steps, namely analog and digital precoding\cite{han2015large, el2014spatially}. More specifically, the transmitted signals are first precoded digitally using a smaller number of RF chains followed by the analog precoding implemented with a much larger number of cheap phase shifters. As a result, the hybrid analog-digital precoding architecture can benefit from the interference suppression provided by the digital precoding while harvesting large antenna beamforming gains by exploiting the massive antennas available in the systems\cite{alkhateeb2014channel}. This new hybrid approach has been proven very successful in reducing the number of RF chains at the cost of marginal performance degradation as compared to the fully digital precoding systems, provided that the minimum number of RF chains has to be twice larger than the number of user data streams \cite{haghighathybrid}.

In contrast, the second challenge is less studied in the massive MIMO literature \cite{mohammed2013per, Chen2017}. In particular, it has been shown that the number of RF chains will have to grow twice faster for hybrid precoders as the number of user data streams increases. This will then present a serious peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) challenge even if the massive MIMO systems are implemented with hybrid precoders. More specifically, since the transmitted signals are linear mixtures of multiple user data streams, the peak power after the digital precoder can theoretically increase up to $M$ folds larger than the average power level with $M$ being the number of user data streams. Unfortunately, to the authors' best knowledge, this second challenge has not been thoroughly investigated in the massive MIMO literature.

In this work, we propose PAPR-aware BDMA for mmWave massive MIMO systems by jointly performing hybrid analog-digital precoding and user-beam scheduling with explicit PAPR constraints. In principle, since these two tasks of precoding design and user-beam scheduling are coupled, hybrid precoders will have to be computed for all combinations of scheduled users exhaustively before the optimal hybrid precoder and user-beam scheduling that give the largest sum-rate capacity are found. To cope with the prohibitive computational complexity, a greedy algorithm is devised to opportunistically and efficiently select users whose array response vectors are nearly orthogonal while the digital precoder is designed to handle the residual interference and PAPR. Compared to the existing BDMA works \cite{sun2015beam, Jiang2018}, our proposed BDMA scheme can achieve multiuser interference-free without requiring perfectly orthogonal beams as residual interference can be removed by digital precoding. Compared to the conventional hybrid precoding proposed in \cite{alkhateeb2014channel}, the proposed digital precoder design will benefit from the additional flexibility to handle PAPR constraints as multiuser interference is suppressed by both analog and digital precoders. Computer simulation is used to confirm the performance of the proposed PAPR-aware BDMA scheme.

\section{System model and problem formulation}
\subsection{System Model}
We consider a multi-user mmWave MIMO system shown in \figurename{\ref{fig:BlockDiagram}}, in which a transmitter equipped with $N_{RF}$ RF chains and $N_T$ antennas transmits $N_U$ data streams to $N_U$ receivers with $N_R$ receive antennas. Following the same assumption commonly employed in the literature \cite{alkhateeb2015limited}, we assume only one data stream is designated to each scheduled receiver. We use ${\bm s}(n)$ to denote the $n$-th block of $N_U$ data to be transmitted with $\mathbb{E}\left[\bm{ss}^H\right]=\frac{1}{N_U}\bm{I}_{N_U}$. In the sequel to this study, we concentrate on a single block and omit the temporal index for notational simplicity. The hybrid precoding system first multiplies ${\bm s}$ with the digital precoding matrix $\bm{F}=\left[{\bm f}_1,{\bm f}_2,\cdots,{\bm f}_{N_U}\right]$ with ${\bm f}_i$ of dimension $N_{RF}\times 1$ being the digital beamforming vector for the $u$-th user, $u=1,2,\cdots,N_U$. After that, the output signal will be multiplied by the analog precoding matrix $\bm{V}=\left[{\bm v}_1,{\bm v}_2,\cdots,{\bm v}_{N_{RF}}\right]$ with ${\bm v}_i$ of dimension $N_T\times 1$ being the $i$-th analog beamforming vector for $i=1,2,\cdots,N_{RF}$. The resulting precoded signal $\bm x$ of dimension $N_T\times 1$  can be expressed as

\begin{equation}{\label{eq:transx1}}
{\bm x} = \bm{V}\cdot \bm{F}\cdot\bm{s}= \bm{V}\sum_{u=1}^{N_U}\bm{f}_us_u
\end{equation}

The precoded signal $\bm x$ is then broadcast to $N_U$ users. The signal received by the $u$-th user is given by

\begin{eqnarray}{\label{eq:transx2}}
{\bm y}_u &=& \bm{H}_u \bm{x} + \bm{n}_u\\
&=&\bm{H}_u \bm{V}\bm{f}_us_u+\bm{H}_u \bm{V}\sum_{\substack{i=1 \\ i\neq u}}^{N_U}\bm{f}_is_i+\bm{n}_u,
\end{eqnarray}
where $\bm{H_u}$$\in\mathbb{C}^{N_R\times N_T}$ is the MIMO channel matrix between the transmitter and the $u$-th receiver\cite{el2014spatially}. Furthermore, $\bm{n}_u$ is complex additive white Gaussian noise with zero mean and variance equal to $\sigma^2$.

Assuming the receivers are all low-cost terminals and only perform only-analog beamforming in decoding, the decoded signal by the $u$-th user denoted by $\hat{s}_u$ is given by
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:hats}}
\hat{s}_u = \bm{w}_u^H \bm{H}_u \bm{V} \bm{f}_{u} \bm{s} + \bm{w}_u^H \bm{\tilde{n}}_u,
\end{equation}
where ${\bm w}_u$ of dimension $N_T\times 1$ is the analog beamforming vector employed by the $u$-th receiver with $|\bm{w}_u|^2=1$ and
\begin{equation}
\bm{\tilde{n}}_u=\bm{H}_u \bm{V}\sum_{\substack{i=1 \\ i\neq u}}^{N_U}\bm{f}_is_i+\bm{n}_u.
\end{equation}
Note that the first term in Eq.~(\ref{eq:hats}) stands for the desired signal while the second term is the sum of its own receiver noise and interference from other users.

\subsection{Channel Model}
As shown in \cite{rappaport2014millimeter}, the mmWave wireless channel can be well modeled by the Saleh-Valenzuela model. Following the same approach developed in \cite{alkhateeb2014channel}, we assume that each scatter only contributes one single propagation path. As a result, the $u$-th user's channel model can been modeled as:
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:Hu}}
\bm{H}_u = \sqrt{\frac{N_{T}N_{R}}{L_{u}}}\sum_{l=1}^{L_u}\alpha_{u,l}\cdot \bm{a}_{R}(\phi^r_{u,l},\theta^r_{u,l}) \cdot\bm{a}_{T}^{H}(\phi^t_{u,l},\theta^t_{u,l}),
\end{equation}
where $L_u$ is the number of scatters of the $u$-th user's channel. Furthermore, $\alpha_{u,l}$, $\theta^r_{u,l}/\phi^r_{u,l}$ and $\theta^t_{u,l}/\phi^t_{u,l}$ are the complex path gain, azimuth/elevation angles of arrival(AoA) and azimuth/elevation angles of departure(AoD) of the $l$-th path of the $u$-th user, respectively. Finally, ${\bm a}$ is the array response vector. For an uniform planar array (UPA) of size $P\times Q$ considered in this work, the array response vector ${\bm a}$ is given by \cite{alkhateeb2014channel}
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:UPAvec1}
&\bm{a}(\phi,\theta) =\frac{1}{\sqrt{N_T}}\left[1,  e^{jkd(\sin\phi \sin\theta +\cos\theta)},\cdots,\right.&&\nonumber\\
&\left. e^{jkd\left(p\sin\phi \sin\theta +q\cos\theta\right)},\cdots, e^{jkd\left((P-1)\sin\phi \sin\theta +(Q-1)\cos\theta\right)}\right]^T,&&
\end{flalign}
where $k=\frac{2\pi}{\lambda}$ is the wavenumber while $d$ is the distance between two adjacent antennas.

In mmWave communications, due to the high path loss and atmospheric absorption, it is common to assume that the channel is dominated by one line-of-sight {\color{red}(LoS)} path, i.e. $L_u=1$ for all users \cite{alkhateeb2014channel}. Under such an assumption, the channel model in Eq.~(\ref{eq:Hu}) can be further simplified as
\begin{equation}{\label{eq:HuLu1}}
	\bm{H}_u = \sqrt{N_{T}N_{R}}\cdot\alpha_u \cdot\bm{a}_{R}(\phi^r_{u},\theta^r_{u})\cdot\bm{a}^{H}_{T}(\phi^t_{u},\theta^t_{u}).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Problem Formulation}
For notational simplicity, we denote by ${\bm{g}}_{u}^H$ the effective array gain of the $u$-th user with
\begin{equation}\label{eq:defgu}
{\bm{g}}_{u}^H = \bm{w}^H_u \bm{H}_u \bm{V}.
\end{equation}

Then, the channel capacity of the $u$-th user is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:6}
	R_u = \log\left(1+\frac{\frac{P}{N_U}|{\bm{g}}_{u}^H \bm{f}_u|^2}{\frac{P}{N_U}\displaystyle\sum_{\substack{i=1 \\ i\neq u}}^{N_U}|{\bm{g}}_{u}^H\bm{f}_i|^2+\sigma^2}\right).
\end{equation}
Subsequently, the system sum-rate capacity that is a function of ${\bm V}$ and ${\bm F}$ can be computed as
\begin{equation}
R_{tot}=\sum_{u=1}^{N_U}R_u.
\end{equation}

Finally, the optimal design of the digital and analog precoding matrices can be formulated as
\begin{align}\label{eq:maxsumrate}
\left\{{\bm V}^*,{\bm F}^*\right\} &= \argmax_{\tilde{\bm V},\tilde{\bm F}} R_{tot}\left(\tilde{\bm V},\tilde{\bm F}\right)\\ \nonumber
s.t. \quad&||\tilde{\bm V}\tilde{\bm f}_u||^2 = 1, \quad u=1,2,\cdots,N_U.
\end{align}

\section{Proposed PAPR-Aware Hybrid Beamforming}
\subsection{PAPR Reduction via Convex Optimization}
For the single-path {\color{red}LoS} environment considered in this work, the channel matrix of the $u$-th user is well structured as given by Eq.~\eqref{eq:HuLu1}. Subsequently, the optimal analog precoding at the transmitter is given by ${\bm v}^*_u = {\bm a}_T\left(\phi^t_u,\theta^t_u\right)$ while the optimal analog beamforming vector at the receiver is given by ${\bm w}^*_u = {\bm a}_R\left(\phi^r_u,\theta^r_u\right)$\cite{alkhateeb2014channel}. Assuming that the transmitter has perfect channel state information (CSI), then all AoA and AoD information, {\em i.e.} $\left\{\phi^t_u,\theta^t_u,\phi^r_u,\theta^r_u\right\}$, is perfectly known to the transmitter. As a result, the optimization problem in Eq.~(\ref{eq:maxsumrate}) can be simplified as
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:optdigPreMat}
{\bm F}^* &= \argmax_{\tilde{\bm F}} R_{tot}\left({\bm V}^*,\tilde{\bm F}\right)\\
s.t. \quad&||{\bm V}^*\tilde{\bm f}_u||^2 = 1 , \quad u=1,2,\cdots,N_U.\nonumber
\end{flalign}

We denote by $\hat{\bm s}=\left[\hat{s}_1,\hat{s}_2,\cdots,\hat{s}_{N_U}\right]^T$ the estimated signal vector. Recalling Eq.~(\ref{eq:hats}), $\hat{\bm s}$ can be expressed as \cite{alkhateeb2014channel}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:hatsAllUsers}
\hat{\bm s} = {\bm G}\cdot \bm{F} \cdot\bm{s} + \bm{\xi},
\end{equation}
where ${\bm G}=\left[{\bm g}_1,{\bm g}_2,\cdots,{\bm g}_{N_U}\right]^H$ is of dimension $N_U\times N_{RF}$ and ${\bm \xi}=\left[{\bm w}_1^H\tilde{\bm n}_1,{\bm w}_2^H\tilde{\bm n}_2,\cdots,{\bm w}_{N_U}^H\tilde{\bm n}_{N_U}\right]^T$. \cite{alkhateeb2014channel} proposed a zero-forcing approach to solve Eq.~(\ref{eq:optdigPreMat}) by setting
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ZFU-HBF}
\bm{F}_{ZF}={\bm G}^\dagger = \bm{G}^H(\bm{G}\bm{G}^H)^{-1},
\end{equation}
with $N_{RF}\geq N_U$.

To satisfy the power constraint, power normalization is performed on each ${\bm f}_u$ derived from $\bm{F}_{ZF}=\left[\bm{f}_{ZF,1},\bm{f}_{ZF,2},\cdots,\bm{f}_{ZF,N_U}\right]$ as
\begin{equation}\label{eq:ZFU-HBF}
\bm{f}^*_{ZF,u} = {\frac{\bm{f}_{ZF,u}}{||\bm{V}\cdot\bm{f}_{ZF,u}||}}.
\end{equation}
In the sequel, the hybrid beamforming scheme derived from Eq.~(\ref{eq:ZFU-HBF}) is referred to as the unconstrained zero-forcing hybrid beamforming (ZFU-HBF) for benchmarking our following proposed schemes.

Since the zero-forcing solution $\bm{F}_{ZF}$ is designed without taking into account the PAPR concerns, the output signal from the digital precoder $\bm{F}_{ZF}$ may suffer from a peak power much larger than its average power level. To circumvent this problem, we first consider the more conventional technique by clipping the signal with a pre-set threshold $\lambda$. Mathematically, each element of $\bm{F}_{ZF}$ is passed through the following filter, for $i=1,2,\cdots, N_{RF}$ and $j=1,2,\cdots, N_{U}$.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:clipping}
 \left[\bm{F}_{ZF}\right]^{clip}_{ij}=\left\{
\begin{aligned}
& \left[\bm{F}_{ZF}\right]_{ij}, &\mbox{if}\quad |\left[\bm{F}_{ZF}\right]_{ij}|\leq\lambda \\
& \lambda, &\mbox{otherwise}  \\
\end{aligned}
\right.
\end{equation}
 In the sequel, the hybrid beamforming scheme derived from Eq.~(\ref{eq:clipping}) is referred to as the zero-forcing with clipping hybrid beamforming (ZFC-HBF).


While clipping is a simple and yet effective technique for PAPR reduction, it inevitably incurs spectral spreading, in-band distortion and subsequently, performance degradation. In sharp contrast to the direct clipping, we propose to incorporate the threshold $\lambda$ into the design of ${\bm F}$. More specifically, we can formulate the optimization problem in Eq.~(\ref{eq:optdigPreMat}) as follows:
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:optdigPreMatPAPR}
{\bm F}^* &= \argmax_{\tilde{\bm F}} R_{tot}\left({\bm V}^*,\tilde{\bm F}\right)\\
s.t. \quad&||{\bm V}^*\tilde{\bm f}_u||^2 = 1 \nonumber\\
\quad &\left|\tilde{\bm f}_{u}\right|_i \leq \lambda \quad\mbox{ for } i=1,2,\cdots,N_{RF}.\nonumber
\end{flalign}
The problem in Eq.~(\ref{eq:optdigPreMatPAPR}) can be approximated by the following convex optimization problem and solved by standard optimization tools such as CVX \cite{cvx}.
\begin{flalign}\label{eq:optdigPreMatCVX}
{\bm F}^* &= \argmin_{\tilde{\bm F}} \|{\bm G}\tilde{\bm F}-{\color{red}{\bm{GF}_{ZF}}}\|^2\\
s.t. \quad&||{\bm V}^*\tilde{\bm f}_u||^2 = 1 \nonumber\\
\quad &\left|\tilde{\bm f}_{u}\right|_i \leq \lambda \quad\mbox{ for } i=1,2,\cdots,N_{RF}.\nonumber
\end{flalign}
{\color{red}The amplitude of each RF chain is constrained to be $\lambda$ by solving the convex optimization problem}. In the sequel, the hybrid beamforming scheme derived from Eq.~(\ref{eq:optdigPreMatPAPR}) is referred to as the {\color{red}PAPR-aware} hybrid beamforming (PAPRA-HBF).

\subsection{PAPR Reduction via Opportunistic Scheduling}
In this section, we consider the joint optimization of analog and digital precoders by incorporating multiuser scheduling into our PAPR reduction design. This is in sharp contrast to the conventional design philosophy. As shown in most existing works \cite{alkhateeb2015limited}, the analog precoder is first optimized to provide the maximum beamforming gain by matching the user's AoD, {\em i.e.} fixing the ${\bm G}$ matrix first before designing the optimal digital precoder to suppress multiuser interference. Since these two steps are performed sequentially, it may become very challenging for the digital precoder to simultaneously suppress interference while reducing PAPR at the same time, particularly if the analog precoders entail heavy multiuser interference. Motivated by this observation, we propose to opportunistically schedule $N_U$ users whose array response vectors $\bm{a}_{T}(\phi^t_u,\theta^t_u)$ are as orthogonal as possible to each others'. As a result, this scheduling scheme will enable the digital precoder to have more degrees of freedom to reduce PAPR. More specifically, we consider scheduling $N_U$ users from $U$ active users. Since the total number of possible combinations given by $C\left(U, N_U\right)=\frac{U!}{(U-N_U)!N_U!}$ can be rather large, it may be infeasible to exhaustively search over all possible combinations to find out the most orthogonal set of $N_U$ users. To cope with this obstacle, we devise a greedy algorithm to select $N_U$ users from the $U$ active users.

\begin{algorithm}[h] 		
	\caption{Greedy scheduling algorithm for PAPR-aware hybrid beamforming}
	\label{selection}
	\begin{algorithmic}
		\REQUIRE  \quad
		\STATE	All user index set: $\mathcal{X}$\\
		\STATE  Selected user index set : $\cal{I}=\emptyset$\\
		\STATE  Number of user to be selected: $N_U$
		\ENSURE   	
		\STATE Initialization: Assign the user index $x$ corresponding to the largest channel gain $|\alpha|$ to ${\cal I}$, {\em i.e.} ${\cal I} \leftarrow  x$ and ${\cal X}\setminus x$	
		\WHILE{$|{\cal I}|< N_U$}
        \STATE Let ${\bm A}=\left[\bm{a}_{T}\left(\phi^t_{i_1},\theta^t_{i_1}\right),\bm{a}_{T}\left(\phi^t_{i_2},\theta^t_{i_2}\right),\cdots,\bm{a}_{T}\left(\phi^t_{i_{|{\cal I}|}},\theta^t_{i_{|{\cal I}|}}\right)\right]$
        \STATE Compute the projection space: ${\bm P}_A = {\bm A}{\bm A}^{\dagger}$ 		 				
		\FOR{$x$ in {$\mathcal{X}$}}
		\STATE $p(x) = \|{\bm P}_A\cdot {\bm a}_T\left(\phi^t_{x},\theta^t_{x}\right)\|^2$ 				 								
		\ENDFOR
		\STATE  Find the user index $x^*$ with the minimum $p(x)$ 									
		\STATE	Update ${\cal I} \leftarrow  x^*$ and ${\cal X}\setminus x^*$	
		\ENDWHILE	
	\end{algorithmic}
\end{algorithm}

Denote by $\cal{I}$ the index set of the selected users. The proposed greedy algorithm first finds the user with the strongest instantaneous channel gain as the first selected user and assigns its index to $\cal{I}$ as its first element $i_1$. The array response vector of the first selected user is given by $\bm{a}_{T}\left(\phi^t_{i_1},\theta^t_{i_1}\right)$. Then, the algorithm will find a user among the remaining users whose array response vector is the most orthogonal to $\bm{a}_{T}\left(\phi^t_{i_1},\theta^t_{i_1}\right)$ and assigns its index to $\cal{I}$ as $i_2$. After that, the algorithm will construct a signal subspace spanned by $\left\{\bm{a}_{T}\left(\phi^t_{i_1},\theta^t_{i_1}\right),\bm{a}_{T}\left(\phi^t_{i_2},\theta^t_{i_2}\right)\right\}$ before projecting the array response vectors of the remaining unselected users onto the signal subspace. The user whose array response vector has the least projection power on the signal subspace will be selected as the third user and assigned to $\cal{I}$ as $i_3$. This process will continue until all $N_U$ users are selected. It should be emphasized that the proposed greedy algorithm is different from the existing opportunistic scheduling algorithms in that user selection is not completely based on instantaneous channel gains\cite{Viswanath2002}. The $N_U$ users selected by the greedy algorithm will have less multiuser interference as they are selected because of their almost orthogonal transmit array response vectors. The above greedy algorithm is summarized in {\bf Algorithm 1} Table.

Upon all $N_U$ users are selected, Eq.~(\ref{eq:optdigPreMatCVX}) can be utilized to derive the optimal digital beamforming vectors with reduced PAPR. In the sequel, the hybrid beamforming scheme proposed in {\bf Algorithm 1} Table is referred to as the PAPR-Aware {\em opportunistic} hybrid beamforming (PAPRA-OHBF).



\section{simulation results}
In this section, we use computer simulation to compare the performance of various hybrid precoding algorithms discussed above in terms of peak-to-average ratio and system sum-rate capacity. Unless specified otherwise, we consider a transmitter equipped with an $8\times 8$ UPA ({\em i.e.} $N_T=64$) and $N_{RF}=4$ RF chains serving $N_U=4$ users each equipped with a $4\times 4$ UPA ({\em i.e.} $N_R=16$). The channels are single-path with the azimuth AoAs/AoDs being uniformly distributed over $[0, 2\pi]$ and the elevation AoAs/AoDs being uniformly distributed in $[-\pi/2, \pi/2]$, respectively. For opportunistic schemes, we consider selecting the $4$ users from $20$ active users. For each computer experiment, we compute the average over 500 realizations.

\begin{figure}[ht]
	\begin{center}
	\includegraphics[width=3.5in,height=2.5in]{Figure/cdf2.eps}
	\caption{Comparison of CDF of off-diagonal elements of the digital precoding matrix ${\bm F}$.}\label{fig:CDF}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

We first compare the PAPR performance by investigating the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the absolute value of the off-diagonal elements of ${\bm F}$ derived from the algorithms discussed above. Inspection of Fig.~\ref{fig:CDF} suggests that ZFU-HBF has the heaviest tail and subsequently the worst PAPR performance. Furthermore, clipping helps to eliminate all values larger than the clipping threshold, {\em $\lambda=2$}. As a result, the curve labeled as ``ZFC-HBF" has no value larger than $2$. Finally, the PAPR-aware schemes, namely ``PAPRA-HBF" and ``PAPRA-OHBF", have much thinner tails and achieve the best PAPR performance.

\begin{figure}[ht]
 	\begin{center}
 	\includegraphics[width=3.6in,height=2.7in]{Figure/SpectralEffNoSelection3.eps}
 	\caption{Comparison of Sum-rate capacity for non-opportunistic schemes.}\label{fig:SpectralEffNoSelection}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Fig.~\ref{fig:SpectralEffNoSelection} shows the sum-rate capacity achieved by the precoding schemes considered in this work. The curve labelled as ``Performance upper bound" is derived from the sum-rate of four single-user systems, assuming all four users have perfectly mutual orthogonal channels. In contrast, the curve labelled ``Analog beamforming" stands for the p0erformance when only analog beamforming is employed to multiplex four users in the spatial domain. Because of lack of digital precoder for interference suppression, Fig.~\ref{fig:SpectralEffNoSelection} has shown that the analog beamforming is interference-dominant. As a result, the performance of analog only beamforming does not improve with the increase of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). This result is particularly surprsing as users whose AoD's are close to others' will exert strong interference to others. Furthermore, comparison of ZFC-HBF and ZFU-HBF suggests that direct clipping the digital precoding matrix incurred noticeable system performance degradation. In contrast, the curved labelled ``PAPRA-HBF" shows the proposed PAPR-aware hybrid beamforming design can achieve better performance as compared to ZFC-HBF.

 	\caption{Comparison of Sum-rate capacity for opportunistic schemes.}\label{fig:SpectralEffWithSelection}
    \end{center}
\end{figure}

Next, we investigate the performance provided by opportunistic hybrid beamforming. Inspection of Fig.~\ref{fig:SpectralEffWithSelection} shows that PAPRA-OHBF can achieve the optimal performance upper bound. Interestingly, as Fig.~\ref{fig:SpectralEffWithSelection} indicates the improvement above is partially attributed to the additional beamforming gain provided by opportunistic analog beamforming.

Finally, we study the multiuser gain provided by opportunistic scheduling. By varying the number of active users, we investigate the sum-rate capacity improvement. Fig.~\ref{fig:MultiuserGain} shows that PAPRA-OHBF can significantly benefit from the increase of active users as the number of active users grows from $6$ to $20$. However, the benefit of having more active users diminishes as the number of active users increases beyond $30$. In contrast, the non-opportunistic analog beamforming is not capable of reaping multiuser gains. As a result, the curve labelled ``Analog Beamforming" does not change much with the number of active users.

\section{Conclusion}
In this work, we have developed PAPR-aware hybrid analog-digital beamforming schemes via convex optimization and opportunistic scheduling. First, we modeled the analog-digital precoder design as a convex optimization problem by specifically imposing the PAPR constraints. Simulation results have confirmed that the optimized precoders can achieve better sum-rate capacity at a lower PAPR than the conventional clipping technique. Furthermore, in contrast to the conventional hybrid design that performs interference cancellation through digital precoding only, we then proposed to reconsider the role of analog precoder by exploiting multiuser gains. By opportunistically scheduling users whose transmit array response vectors are close to be orthogonal, we proposed a PAPR-aware opportunistic hybrid beamforming scheme. To efficiently schedule users with the least interference, we develop a greedy algorithm to opportunistically select users based on their transmit array response vectors. Simulation results have confirmed that the proposed PAPR-aware opportunistic hybrid beamforming scheme can achieve near optimal capacity bound.
